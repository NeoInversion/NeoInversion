<h1>Hello there!</h1>

I'm a programmer who enjoys reverse engineering and educating myself. Sometimes I create games on Roblox with my friend littensy.

I know C++, C#, Java, Lua, Python, and while I don't particularly enjoy web development, I'm familiar with JavaScript and PHP.

I mostly work in C++ and Lua.
