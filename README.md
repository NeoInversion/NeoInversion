<h1>Hello there!</h1>

I’m a software and web developer who uses various languages, primarily C++ and Lua, sometimes using C#, Java, and JavaScript. I don’t like using Python or PHP, but they are part of my skill set.

If you wish to contact me, the preferred method is through Discord, which is found at Inversion#9797.
